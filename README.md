# Cnotheus

It's a frontend grid, for which i created a custom Drag and Drop. The scroll is animated and you can add cards.

The application is entirely in vanilla JS and have only two dependencies :

- Dotenv
- Handlebars JS

The front rely on a Symfony back-end [here](https://github.com/Bulliby/notheus).

You can test it [here](https://cnotheus.wellsguillaume.fr)
